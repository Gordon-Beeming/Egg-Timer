# Version 1.0

Very basic functionality. You are basically just able to start and stop a egg timer (which at the moment isn't a time =P) but what this does is switch Lync to Do not disturb and then back to Free on stopping it.

More release notes can be seen on the project page out on GitHub - https://github.com/Gordon-Beeming/Egg-Timer.
